## Let's Split ##

### Make damn well sure that your friends pay you back. ###

Split is a very simple price splitting application built using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), and modeled after [Ccoenraet's](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-backbone-topcoat-require) boilerplate backbone app.

API calls to google and venmo enable accurate distance calculations and payment integration with your friends.

We developed this in under 24 hours at Hackbeanpot in Cambridge, and we had a blast doing it!!

Safe driving!
